# 👋 I'm Yasir.

I’m a developer based in Pakistan who is obsessed with **efficiency**.

Most developers argue about which language is best. I prefer to ask: *"What gets this into the hands of users fastest?"* 

That's why my workflow is a hybrid:
1.  **Fullstack Engineering** (React, Node, TS) for heavy lifting and custom logic.
2.  **No-Code & Automation** to handle the repetitive stuff instantly.
3.  **AI Integration** to make apps smarter, not just functional.

Whether you're looking to integrate a complex API or build a dashboard from scratch, I'm the guy who enjoys the puzzle of putting it all together.
