### Hey there! 👋

I’m **Yasir Khan** — a **Full‑Stack Developer & AI Engineer** who builds production-ready web apps and **LLM products** (especially **doc-aware chatbots** and **RAG systems**) with a focus on **reliability, low hallucinations, and great UX**.

- ✅ Strong at shipping end‑to‑end: frontend → backend → auth/billing → deployment  
- ✅ Comfortable owning the full lifecycle: discovery → build → eval → iterate → monitor  
- ✅ I care about clean systems, fast performance, and measurable product outcomes  

---

## What I build (and why it works)

### 🤖 Doc-aware chatbots & support automation
I build customer support / FAQ assistants that are grounded in real documentation and designed to be **trustworthy**:
- Retrieval that prioritizes correct answers (high-signal chunking + reranking when needed)
- Guardrails to reduce hallucinations (citations, fallback flows, “I don’t know” behavior)
- Practical features: conversation memory, source links, admin controls, analytics

**Typical use cases:** help centers, internal knowledge bases, onboarding assistants, product Q&A.

---

### 🌱 RAG pipelines & LLM application architecture
I design and implement RAG systems that are maintainable in production:
- Chunking strategies, embeddings, retrieval tuning
- Evaluation workflows (test sets, regression checks, quality scoring)
- Observability and iteration loops (what users asked, where retrieval failed, what to fix)

---

### ⚙️ Full‑stack apps that scale
I ship modern apps with the “real world” pieces included:
- Auth, roles, multi‑tenant architecture
- Dashboards, APIs, integrations
- Billing/checkout flows and operational tooling

---

## How I work
- **Product-minded engineering:** I optimize for user outcomes, not just “working code.”
- **Pragmatic architecture:** simple where possible, structured where needed.
- **Quality & reliability:** predictable behavior, good error handling, and performance discipline.

## Proof (add your best 2–4 bullets here)
If you have any measurable wins, this section boosts hireability a lot. Examples:
- Built a doc-aware support chatbot that reduced repetitive tickets by **[X%]**
- Shipped a multi-tenant SaaS dashboard used by **[X]** users / teams
- Improved answer accuracy from **[X] → [Y]** using retrieval tuning + evals
- Reduced response time by **[X%]** with caching / streaming / architecture changes
